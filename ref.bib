  note = {The medial collateral ligament is one of four major ligaments that support the knee. The MCL is the prime static stabilizer of the medial side of the knee joint, and is important for providing support against valgus stress, rotational forces, and anterior translational forces on the tibia
\par
In a 10-year observational study in athletes, it was found that MCL tears accounted for 7.9\% of all the knee injuries. MCL injuries occur commonly in athletes, either through trauma or sudden changes in direction or speed. The valgus stress or rotational forces associated with these events can either strain or tear the ligament, as well as affect other structures of the knee such as the ACL, PCL, and menisci
\par
The medial collateral ligament is part of the capsuloligamentous complex of the medial knee. This region of the knee is divided into three layers: the superficial layer, middle layer, and deep layer. The superficial layer is comprised sartorius and the investing fascia which forms part of the patellar retinaculum. The middle layer includes semimembranosus, the superficial MCL, the medial patellofemoral ligament, and the posterior oblique ligament. The deep layer includes the deep MCL, the posterior medial capsule, and the meniscotibial ligament.3 The MCL, an 8 to 10 cm ligament in length, is the largest structure found on the medial aspect of the knee joint
\par
Clinical exam of the knee in patients suspected of having an MCL tear should be done within 20\textendash 30 min if possible to avoid complications related to the injury such as pain, swelling, and muscle spasm, using the contralateral leg as a control. In order to isolate the MCL, the knee should be flexed to 30. This can be accomplished by raising the leg manually, or in larger patients, the thigh can rest on the table while the lower leg hangs over the side of table with the foot and ankle supported. The examiner will then apply a valgus force to the knee and even a small 5\textendash 8 mm medial joint opening is indicative of MCL injury.7 In addition to testing the MCL, it is important to test for associated injuries including: ACL, PCL, or medial meniscus (Figs. 6 and 7). Combined injuries to the ACL and MCL are the most common multi-ligament knee injuries in the general population and are usually associated with grade 3 MCL tears.
\par
The gold standard for diagnosing an MCL injury is diagnostic arthroscopy and surgical exploration, however, this is rarely done. Diagnosis of an MCL injury can reliably be done with clinical history and physical exam. The history will describe a recent trauma in which valgus stress was placed on the lateral knee or a non-contact sensation of the knee ``giving away'' and ``popping'' while the patient attempted to change direction rapidly. Positive findings on physical exam will be a medial opening to valgus stress and tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the knee. Physical exam findings are a reliable and accurate way of both diagnosing and grading MCL injuries.10 Imaging with MRI is usually reserved for cases of severe trauma or where suspected multiligament injury occurredfavorable with early return to sport/work likely. In one study, high school football players with grade 1 tears returned to sport an average of 10.6 days post-injury and those with grade 2 tears returned an average of 19.5 days post-injury.15 Grade 3 tears are managed similarly to grade 1 and 2 tears if they are injured in isolation to any other ligaments of the knee. Unlike anterior cruciate ligament tears, most MCL tears are either proximal or distal, and have a good blood supply for healing.16 However, most grade 3 MCL injuries are severe, and the risk of an associated ligament injury is 78\%, with the anterior cruciate ligament being the associated injury 95\% of the time.17 It is recommended that chronic MCL tears are repaired surgically with reconstruction, as non-operative treatment may lead to chronic valgus or rotatory instability with subsequent arthritis.6 Associated injuries such as ACL tears should be repaired after MCL rehabilitation, which may take up to 8 weeks
\par
In a group of patients with isolated grade 3 MCL injuries, the recurrence of MCL injury was 23\%.18 Scarring and adhesions can be reduced or avoided with early mobilization of the joint
\par
The mainstay of treatment for grade 1 and grade 2 injuries (Hughston's Classification System) is conservative treatment, with early rehabilitation and ROM exercises with progressive strength training.13 Early joint motion is a central concept of rehabilitation as animal models have found that immobilized joints lead to weaker ligament healing and poorer outcomes.14 Early use of a hinged knee brace can also be used to prevent further valgus injury. Weight bearing is encouraged once pain has subsided and rehabilitation with strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstrings follows},

  note = {The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on MCL injuries in adult athletes with a focus on diagnosis, conservative management options, and return to play.
\par
This paper reviews the literature over the past 10 years regarding MCL diagnosis, management, and return to play (RTP). 
\par
Recent Findings: The recent literature focuses on the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of MCL injuries, the use of orthobiologics for acute MCL injury management, and better characterization of timing for RTP. 
\par
Summary: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), in the hands of an experienced individual, is a reasonable alternative if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not easily available because it is cost efcient, easy to use, safe, and accurate. Studies and case reports on orthobiologic injections for acute MCL injuries have mixed results requiring more research before being implemented as standard treatment. 
\par
General expectations for RTP in athletes with an isolated MCL injury for grade I are 1 to 2 weeks and for grade II is 3 to 4 weeks. Keywords Knee medial collateral ligament~{$\cdot$} Isolated MCL knee injury~{$\cdot$} Acute MCL knee injury~{$\cdot$} MCL knee injury in athlete~{$\cdot$} MCL injury management~{$\cdot$} MCL injury rehabilitation
\par
In athletes, the knee is one of the most commonly injured joints. It is a complex structure comprising multiple stabilizing elements essential to participation and performance in sports. The medial collateral ligament (MCL), one of the primary stabilizing structures in the knee, is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee overall [1]. Sports commonly cited in the literature as having a high rate of MCL injuries include wrestling, hockey, judo, rugby, football, skiing, and soccer [2\textendash 6]. MCL injuries are prevalent within many different types of sports and at all levels of sport\textemdash{} high school, collegiate, and professional. In high school athletes, MCL injuries account for 36\% of knee injuries. 
\par
The mechanism of MCL injury occurs via contact about 70\% of the time, either with another player or an object [6,9]. A valgus force applied to the knee, either by direct contact or with cutting or changing direction, will strain the MCL fibers and potentially cause a stretch or a tear.
\par
MCL tears can occur in isolation or as part of a multi-ligamentous injury. The incidence of combined ACL and MCL injuries can be as high as 38\%.
\par
Anatomi: The average dimensions of the MCL have been described has 3-cm wide, 10- to 11-cm long, attaching approximately 6-cm distally to the medial joint line and comprising two well-defined layers [12, 13]. These are the superficial MCL (sMCL, also called the tibial collateral ligament) and the deep MCL (dMCL, also called the mid-third medial capsular ligament). There is a third structure, the posterior oblique ligament (POL), which has been argued as either a distinct structure or as a component of the sMCL. 
\par
Diagnostisering: Given that the typical mechanism of MCL injury occurs during contact in sport, efficiency of the history and physical examination to initiate a diagnosis and treatment plan is important. Different imaging modalities, such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, play a role in aiding the diagnosis. It is important to perform a good history and physical examination, along with selecting the appropriate diagnostic tests.
\par
Understanding the mechanism of injury is an important first step in obtaining the patient's history. Features commonly reported in the history of a patient with an MCL injury might include contact to the lateral knee causing a valgus load on the knee joint or planting the leg with rotation at the knee with no contact. Patients may describe a pop of the knee when this occurs, or they may feel their knee give out. Patients may report medial knee swelling or a sensation of instability, particularly with lateral movements. MCL injuries typically have an acute onset of pain and symptoms, and they are rarely caused by repetitive overuse injuries.
\par
The physical exam is critical to the proper diagnosis and assessment of the severity of a knee injury. Ideally, the physical examination should occur as soon as possible after the injury before swelling, guarding, and muscle spasms occur, making it more difficult to comfortably and accurately examine the patient. The exam consists of inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength, special maneuvers, and neurovascular testing.

Grade I injury is a first-degree tear with minimal fiber involvement that has local tenderness but no instability. Grade II injury ~is a second-degree tear with more fiber involvement, more diffuse tenderness, and no instability. Grade III injury is a third-degree tear with ligament rupture and instability [17]. Grade III injuries are further divided based on laxity. The knee is put into 30\textdegree{} of flexion, and a valgus force is applied. The degree of separation at the medial joint is graded as follows: 1+ (3\textendash 5 mm), 2+ (6\textendash 10 mm), 3+ ({$>$} 10 mm) [17].

Behandling oftest konservativ. Oppstart s\aa{} raskt som mulig med ROM innenfor smerte, isometrisk qadriceps, etterhvert aktivering av hofte.

Indications for surgical intervention of MCL tears include associated bony avulsions or fractures,
\par
tears at the tibia leading to entrapment of the ligament in the knee joint, Stener-Like lesions, multi-ligamentous injuries, anteromedial rotatory instability (AMRI), tibial plateaufracture, valgus instability in patients with valgus knee alignment in natural stance, persistent pain, and tenderness lasting greater than 6 weeks.

\par
71\% of athletes were able to return to play at an elite level. 
\par
Only 14\% of the athletes required surgical intervention. Ultimately, there was a 3\% reinjury rate of the MCL after return to play.
\par
In Division I male ice hockey players with a clinically diagnosed MCL injury, the RTP was 2\textendash 4 days for grade I MCL injury, 10\textendash 19 days for grade II injury, and 127 days for grade III injury
\par
In counseling a patient, it would be reasonable to say that RTP timing is about 1 to 2 weeks for an isolated grade I injury and 3 to 4 weeks for an isolated grade II injury. RTP for grade III and MLKIs is variable depending on the structures involved, but can range from 4 months to 1 year},

  abstract = {Until recently, there has been less demand for and interest in female-specific sport and exercise science data. As a result, the vast majority of high-quality sport and exercise science data have been derived from studies with men as participants, which reduces the application of these data due to the known physiological differences between the sexes, specifically with regard to reproductive endocrinology. Furthermore, a shortage of specialist knowledge on female physiology in the sport science community, coupled with a reluctance to effectively adapt experimental designs to incorporate female-specific considerations, such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy and the menopause, has slowed the pursuit of knowledge in this field of research. In addition, a lack of agreement on the terminology and methodological approaches (i.e., gold-standard techniques) used within this research area has further hindered the ability of researchers to adequately develop evidenced-based guidelines for female exercisers. The purpose of this paper was to highlight the specific considerations needed when employing women (i.e., from athletes to non-athletes) as participants in sport and exercise science-based research. These considerations relate to participant selection criteria and adaptations for experimental design and address the diversity and complexities associated with female reproductive endocrinology across the lifespan. This statement intends to promote an increase in the inclusion of women as participants in studies related to sport and exercise science and an enhanced execution of these studies resulting in more high-quality female-specific data.},

In general, non-operative Grade I lesions were immobilized for 2 weeks, usually by means of a knee splint i.e. Jordan splint; Whereas Grade I1 and Grade 111 lesions were treated by cylinder plasters for 4-6 and 6-10 weeks respectively. Cast-bracing was employed in some Grade 3 lesions after an initial 6 weeks in a long leg cylinder plaster to allow active physical therapy through a protected range of motion. Following this period of immobilization, each patient was begun on a lower extremity muscle strengthening program directed particularly at the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.

"Cylinder plasters on knees" likely refers to a particular type of knee cast or orthopedic cast used to immobilize the knee joint. These casts are typically cylindrical or tubular in shape and are applied around the knee to provide support, protection, and immobilization for the knee joint.(chat gpt)},

Resistance training for older adults: position statement from the national strength and conditioning association. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000\textendash 000, 2019\textemdash Aging, even in the absence of chronic disease, is associated with a variety of biological changes that can contribute to decreases in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. Such losses decrease physiologic resilience and increase vulnerability to catastrophic events. As such, strategies for both prevention and treatment are necessary for the health and well-being of older adults. The purpose of this Position Statement is to provide an overview of the current and relevant literature and provide evidence-based recommendations for resistance training for older adults. As presented in this Position Statement, current research has demonstrated that countering muscle disuse through resistance training is a powerful intervention to combat the loss of muscle strength and muscle mass, physiological vulnerability, and their debilitating consequences on physical functioning, mobility, independence, chronic disease management, psychological well-being, quality of life, and healthy life expectancy. This Position Statement provides evidence to support recommendations for successful resistance training in older adults related to 4 parts: (a) program design variables, (b) physiological adaptations, (c) functional benefits, and (d) considerations for frailty, sarcopenia, and other chronic conditions. The goal of this Position Statement is to a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to resistance training for older adults, b) promote the health and functional benefits of resistance training for older adults, and c) prevent or minimize fears and other barriers to implementation of resistance training programs for older adults.},

This remains unexplored.                                                           Here, 34 untrained individuals performed contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12~weeks. Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength and type II fibre-type transitions.

Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose\textendash response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy.                                                           These results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis.                                                                                            Abstract                                Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males                 n                 ~=~16, 23.6 (4.1)~years; females                 n                 ~=~18, 22.0 (1.3)~years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12~weeks (2\textendash 3 sessions~per week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1~h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\%                 versus                 3.7 (3.7)\%,                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.001) and strength (3.4\textendash 7.7\% difference, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week~0 to Week~12 (MOD, -4.6 percentage points; LOW -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase~1 (p85 S6K1                 Thr412                 , 19\%; p70 S6K1                 Thr389                 , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6                 Ser235/236                 (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week~2, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week~2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (                 P                 ~=~0.005) and 9.8\% (                 P                 ~=~0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training responses.                                       ,              Key points                                                                For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate responses.

  note = {Combined injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) remains among the most common knee injury patterns in orthopaedics. Optimal treatment of grade III MCL injuries is still debated, especially when combined with ACL injury. Most patients with these severe injuries are treated conservatively for at least 6 weeks to allow for MCL healing, followed by delayed ACL reconstruction. Although acute treatment of the MCL was common in the 1970s, postoperative stiffness was frequently reported. Moreover, studies of such treatment failed to show clinical benefits of surgical over conservative treatment, and the MCL exhibited intrinsic healing capacity, leading to the consensus that all MCL injuries are treated conservatively. The current delayed treatment algorithm for ACL-MCL injuries has several disadvantages. First, MCL healing may be incomplete, resulting in residual valgus laxity that places the ACL graft at greater risk of failure. Second, delayed treatment lengthens the overall rehabilitation period, thereby prolonging the presence of atrophy and delaying return to preinjury activity levels. Third, the initial healing period leaves the knee unstable for longer and risks further intra-articular damage. Acute simultaneous surgical treatment of both ligaments has the potential to avoid these shortcomings. This article will review the evolution of treatment of ACL-MCL injuries and explain how it shifted toward the current treatment algorithm. We will (1) discuss why the consensus shifted, (2) discuss the shortcomings of the current treatment plan, (3) discuss the potential advantages of acute simultaneous treatment, and (4) present an overview of the available literature.
\par
It is commonly agreed that this ligament has improved healing capacity compared with the ACL.\textsuperscript{5,6}~Therefore, most isolated and incomplete MCL tears are treated conservatively, whereas ACL tears most often require surgery.~
\par
Grade I and II MCL tears are treated conservatively,\textsuperscript{7,8}~but treatment of grade III MCL tears is less clear, especially when combined with ACL injury. Historically, repair of the MCL was recommended after Fetto and Marshall\textsuperscript{4}~(1978) reported that 79\% of combined ACL-MCL grade II or III lesions treated conservatively had poor outcomes at an average of 25 months postoperatively. Soon thereafter, a series of animal and clinical studies showed the natural healing capacity of the MCL, especially in isolated cases.5, 6, 7\textsuperscript{,}9, 10, 11, 12, 13 By the late 1980s, conservative treatment of most MCL injuries became the accepted protocol, irrespective of concomitant ligamentous injury.\textsuperscript{10,}14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 The opposite was found for the ACL, which led to the adoption of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) as the gold-standard treatment for the past 40 years.\textsuperscript{21}}

Falls in the elderly are considered one of the most serious and expensive public health problems in terms of morbidity, mortality, and enormous costs to health and social services\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Falls are considered a geriatric syndrome that is associated with extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The extrinsic causes are usually related to the home environment such as rugs, stairs, and poor lighting, among others6, while the intrinsic causes are related to an impairment in balance or gait, muscle weakness, decreased visual acuity, cognitive deficits, the presence of chronic disease, postural hypotension or the use of psychotropic medication\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft studies have shown that the most effective interventions for preventing falls are based on balance training and lower limb muscle strengthening\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)

Bayesian methods are one of them, and they are gaining increasing attention in medical research, as some of their advantages include the description of model parameters in terms of probability, as well as the incorporation of prior information in contrast to the frequentist framework. While Bayesian methods are not the only remedy to the situation, there is an increasing agreement that they are an essential way to avoid common misconceptions and false interpretation of study results. The requirements necessary for applying Bayesian statistics have transitioned from detailed programming knowledge into simple point-and-click programs like JASP. Still, the multitude of Bayesian significance and effect measures which contrast the gold standard of significance in medical research, the                 p                 -value, causes a lack of agreement on which measure to report.                                                        Methods               Therefore, in this paper, we conduct an extensive simulation study to compare common Bayesian significance and effect measures which can be obtained from a posterior distribution. In it, we analyse the behaviour of these measures for one of the most important statistical procedures in medical research and in particular clinical trials, the two-sample Student's (and Welch's) t-test.                                         Results               The results show that some measures cannot state evidence for both the null and the alternative. While the different indices behave similarly regarding increasing sample size and noise, the prior modelling influences the obtained results and extreme priors allow for cherry-picking similar to p-hacking in the frequentist paradigm. The indices behave quite differently regarding their ability to control the type I error rates and regarding their ability to detect an existing effect.                                         Conclusion               Based on the results, two of the commonly used indices can be recommended for more widespread use in clinical and biomedical research, as they improve the type I error control compared to the classic two-sample t-test and enjoy multiple other desirable properties.},

Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen men (21 {$\pm$} 1 yr, 22.6 {$\pm$} 2.1 kg/m               2               ; means {$\pm$} SE) had their legs randomly assigned to two of three training conditions that differed in contraction intensity [\% of maximal strength (1 repetition maximum)] or contraction volume (1 or 3 sets of repetitions): 30\%-3, 80\%-1, and 80\%-3. Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant ( P {$<$} 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30\%-3 = 6.8 {$\pm$} 1.8\%, 80\%-1 = 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.8\%, and 80\%-3= 7.2 {$\pm$} 1.9\%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80\%-1 and 80\%-3, but were greater than 30\%-3 ( P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions ( P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation ( P {$<$} 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80\%-1 and 80\%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy. In accordance with our previous acute measurements of muscle protein synthetic rates a lower load lifted to failure resulted in similar hypertrophy as a heavy load lifted to failure.},

The isokinetic strength was measured in both lower limbs with a dynamometer at 60\textdegree/s and 180\textordmasculine/s. The multivariate analysis (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni test assessed the group and time effect. Significant and positive effects were observed in the time and group interaction in the power group at 180\textdegree/s and 60\textdegree/s knee flexion in the dominant (p = 0.004, respectively) and non-dominant (p = 0.046 and p = 0.041, respectively) lower limbs. The Control group had significant and negative effect on the time x group interaction at 180\textdegree/s and 60\textdegree/s on the extension of the dominant knee (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively) and non-dominant (p = 0.003 and p\&lt; 0.001, respectively).

They are usually the result of an acute blow to the lateral aspect of the knee. The diagnosis can usually be made on the basis of a characteristic clinical examination. The treatment of these injuries has evolved over several years. Current recommended treatment for isolated MCL sprains is lightweight support and an aggressive early functional rehabilitation programme. In combined injuries, cruciate ligaments are usually surgically reconstructed and the MCL treated non-operatively. Although many braces have been developed to prevent MCL sprains, their effectiveness is uncertain.}

Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed statistically significant differences favoring S-3 in the leg press (p {$<$} 0.05, effect size [ES] = 6.5) and differences approaching significance in the bench press (p = 0.07, ES = 2.3). The results demonstrate that for recreationally trained individuals using DUP training, 3 sets of training are superior to 1 set for eliciting maximal strength gains.},

Background:A medial collateral ligament (MCL) knee sprain is a prevalent injury in athletic populations that may result in significant time lost to injury. Remarkably little is known of the epidemiology of this injury.
\par
Purpose:To define the incidence of MCL tears and to determine the demographic and athletic risk factors.
\par
Study Design:Descriptive epidemiological study.
\par
Methods:A longitudinal cohort study was performed to examine the epidemiology of isolated MCL sprains at the United States Military Academy (USMA) between 2005 and 2009. Charts and radiographic studies were reviewed by an independent orthopaedic surgeon to identify all new isolated MCL sprains resulting in time lost to sport and activity that occurred within the study period. Incidence rates (IRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated per 1000 person-years at risk and by sex, sport, and level of competition. The IR per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs) was also determined. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and respective 95\% CIs were calculated between male and female students, intercollegiate and intramural athletes, and male and female intercollegiate athletes involved in selected sports. Chi-square and Poisson regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between the variables of interest and the incidence of MCL sprains, with statistical significance set at P {$<$} .05.
\par
Results:A total of 128 cadets sustained isolated MCL injuries during 17,606 student person-years from 2005 to 2009. This resulted in an IR of approximately 7.3 per 1000 person-years. Of the 128 injuries, 114 were in male athletes (89\%) and 14 were in female athletes (11\%).

Of 21,805 at-risk intramural athletes, with quarterly participation, 16 (all male) sustained isolated MCL injuries during 225,683 AEs for an overall IR of 0.07 per 1000 AEs. The IRs of MCL injuries of intercollegiate and intramural athletes did not differ significantly. In intercollegiate sports, wrestling (0.57), judo (0.36), hockey (0.34), and rugby (men's, 0.22; women's, 0.23) had the highest IRs per 1000 AEs.

Among women's intercollegiate sports as well as intramural sports, there were no significant differences in IRs. A median of 16 days was lost to injury, with 2407 total days lost for all injuries. Grade 1 MCL injuries lost a median of 13.5 days, while higher grade injuries lost a median of 29 days.
\par
Conclusion:Medial collateral ligament injuries are relatively common in athletic cohorts. The most injurious sports are contact sports such as wrestling, hockey, judo, and rugby. Male athletes are at a greater risk than female athletes. Intercollegiate athletes are at a greater risk than intramural athletes. The average amount of time lost per injury was 23.2 days, with greater time lost with higher grade sprains than grade 1 sprains.
\par
Several descriptive studies have looked at sportsrelated knee injuries in general and note that MCL injuries are common in skiing, rugby,football, soccer and ice hockey.

\par
\guillemotleft Muscle strength is considered a fundamental component of physical fitness related to quality of life.1,2 For elderly individuals, strength training is important to maintain functional ability because strength progressively declines with aging,3,4 which significantly affects the ability to perform activities of daily living.5\textendash 7 Therefore it is important to determine the optimum dose or amount of strength training that should be prescribed to increase strength in this population. A dose\textendash response relationship between strength increases and training variables such as training volume (number of repetitions per set, number of sets per exercise), training intensity (percent of one repetition maximum), and duration of training may exist in the elderly as such relationships do exist in younger individuals\guillemotright{} (Silva et al., 2014, p. 337)

\guillemotleft{} In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggested that different combinations of training variables (intensity, number of sets per muscle group, weekly training frequency) may be equally effective to improve the strength of healthy sedentary elderly people, at least in the knee extension exercise (quadriceps muscle strengthening). However, the only training variable investigated showing a significant effect-size for strength gain, within a meta-regression including the other variables, was training duration. This finding indicates that the longer the duration of resistance training programs, the greater the strength gains achieved by elderly individuals, regardless of different combinations of training intensity, frequency, or number of sets.\guillemotright{} (Silva et al., 2014, p. 343)},

Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10\textendash 12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was -7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {$<$} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {$<$} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {$<$} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {$<$} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461.

Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes, Second Edition, guides readers in ensuring precision and reliability of testing procedures in the field or lab; correctly preparing athletes before testing; and accurately collecting, handling, and analyzing data. It leads readers through general testing concepts and athlete monitoring tools for determining anaerobic capacity, neuromuscular power, blood lactate thresholds, and VO2max. It also presents principles and protocols for common lab- and field-based assessments of body composition, agility, strength and power, and perceptual and decision-making capabilities. Reproducible forms throughout the book assist readers with data collection and preparticipation screening. After reviewing general protocols, this unique text takes a sport-specific look at the most effective tests and their applications in enhancing the performance of elite athletes. Protocols for 18 internationally recognized sports are introduced, and for each sport a rationale for the tests, lists of necessary equipment, and detailed testing procedures are provided. Normative data collected from athletes competing at national and international levels serve as excellent reference points for measuring elite athletes. New to the second edition are sport-specific assessments for Australian football, BMX cycling, rugby, sprint kayaking, high-performance walking, and indoor and beach volleyball. The second edition of Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes also features other enhancements, including extensive updates to normative data and reference material as well as several new chapters. New information on data collection and handling covers approaches for analyzing data from the physiological monitoring of individual athletes and for groups of athletes in team sports. Revised chapters on environmental physiology provide current insights regarding altitude training and training in heat and humidity. Discussions of the scientific basis of various strategies for athlete recovery in both training and competition enable readers to make sound decisions in employing those strategies to help their athletes optimally recover. For exercise physiologists, coaches, and exercise physiology students, Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes, Second Edition, is the essential guide to the most effective assessment protocols available. Using the precise and proven protocols in this authoritative resource, exercise physiologists can acquire detailed information to assist athletes' preparation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Optimal prescription of resistance exercise load (kg) is essential for the development of maximal strength. Two methods are commonly used in practice with no clear consensus on the most effective approach for the improvement of maximal strength.                                         Objective               The primary aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of percentage 1RM (\% 1RM) and repetition maximum targets (RM) as load prescription methods for the development of maximal strength.                                         Methods                                Electronic database searches of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were eligible for inclusion if a direct measure of maximal strength was used, a non-training control group was a comparator, the training intervention was\,{$>$}\,4~weeks in duration and was replicable, and participants were defined as healthy and between the ages of 18\textendash 40. Methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Percentage change (\%) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for all strength-based training groups were calculated. Statistical significance (                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05) was reported from each study.                                                        Results               Twenty-two studies comprising a total of 761 participants (585 males and 176 females) were found to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 studies were returned for \% 1RM, with 10 for RM. All studies showed statistically significant improvements in maximal strength in the training groups (31.3\,{$\pm$}\,21.9\%; 95\% CI 33.1\textendash 29.5\%). The mean quality rating for all studies was 17.7\,{$\pm$}\,2.3. Four studies achieved a good methodological rating, with the remainder classified as moderate.                                         Conclusions               Both \% 1RM and RM are effective tools for improving maximal strength. \% 1RM appears to be a better prescriptive method than RM potentially due to a more sophisticated management of residual fatigue. However, large heterogeneity was present within this data. Lower body and multi-joint exercises appear to be more appropriate for developing maximal strength. Greater consensus is required in defining optimal training prescriptions, physiological adaptations, and training status.},

In the Western world we live in a society obsessed by sport. At recreational level, this allows an escape from the pressures of modern life, and, at the elite level, sport is now an established part of the entertainment industry, with enormous material rewards for the participants. At all levels, injury is a constant threat, and, of all injuries, those of the knee fulfil the athlete's greatest fear of spending a long time out of action. This is confirmed by a study from Sheffield, which showed the knee to have been the most commonly injured joint and soccer and rugby to have the highest risks.1 It has been said of our national game that it is not so much a sport as a knee disease! Not only may a knee injury require surgery followed by months of rehabilitation, but permanent disability from both sport and work may be the outcome. Indeed, a large study from Scandinavia found that the most common cause of permanent disability following a sports injury was injury to the knee (Kujala 1995)},
