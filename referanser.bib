The purpose of this case report is to introduce and describe the early use of a daily adjustable progressive resistance exercise (DAPRE) protocol as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation to maximize quadriceps muscle strength and functional performance in an elderly homebound patient following a TKA. Case description: A 61-year-old female was referred to home care physical therapy for 6 weeks following left TKA due to functional deficits and inability to activate the weak left quadriceps muscle. In phase I, the patient received three visits with emphasis on edema management, improving left knee range of motion, and reducing pain. Phase II consisted of two main components: (1) a DAPRE protocol aimed at maximizing the quadriceps strength and (2) functional training aimed at improving normal gait patterns, transfers, and dynamic balance. Outcomes: The patient made substantial improvements in both quadriceps muscle strength and functional performance in the first seven weeks following the TKA. The patient had a pain free return to daily living activities. Discussion: The results suggest that early initiation of a DAPRE protocol was free of adverse events and improved quadriceps strength and functional performance for this patient.},

Introduksjon:

\guillemotleft Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical procedure designed to alleviate knee pain and improve function in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis.\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 287)
\par
\guillemotleft Most patients who undergo TKA are between the ages of 50 and 80 years.\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 287)
\par
\guillemotleft Of particular interest to rehabilitation professionals is the acute profound post-operative deficit in quadriceps muscle strength that fails to resolve completely even years after surgery (Meier et al, 2008). Quadriceps weakness has been correlated with slower walking speeds, longer stairclimbing times and increased risk of falls (Chandler, Duncan, Kochersberger, and Studenski, 1998).\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 287)
\par
\guillemotleft The decline in muscle strength is higher, amounting to 1.5\% per year between ages 50 and 60 and 3\% per year thereafter.\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 287)
\par
\guillemotleft A daily adjustable progressive resistance exercise (DAPRE) protocol is a structured progressive strengthening technique developed clinically by Knight (1990) in an effort to provide an objective means of increasing resistance concurrently with strength increases during knee rehabilitation subsequent to injury or surgery (Knight, 1990). The DAPRE system is a 5-RM to 7-RM (repetition maximum) with a 4-set system.\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 288)
\par
Resultat:
\par
\guillemotleft The DAPRE technique and functional training were found to be effective at improving quadriceps extension strength and functional performance such as walking, balance, and stairs climbing in this patient following TKA over five weeks.\guillemotright{} (Ardali, 2014, p. 293)},

Current evidence suggests knee extensor strength loss in the elderly is reversed by exercisea,4,5.

\guillemotleft Results of this study revealed that the HI training protocol caused the most impressive improvement of the knee extensors' isokinetic performance as compared to LI or MI at all testing velocities. However, moderate- and lowintensity training groups caused a significant strength improvement as well, but at a lesser extent. Specifically, the male participants in HI increased their performance by 7.3\%- 11.2\% and females by 2.3\%- 15.2\%. In MI, improvement ranged between 6.4\% and 9.2\% for males and 1.9\% to 7.9\% for females respectively. In LI the corresponding numbers were 2.2\%-5.2\% for males and 2.6\%-3.7\% for females.\guillemotright{} (Beneka et al., 2005, p. 279)},

The 95\% limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95\% of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

To assess the role of training volumes, studies in which training protocols were matched for mechanical work were independently analyzed. In all 15 studies included (448 subjects, age 67.8 years), when comparing heavy with light-moderate loads, strength gains tended to be larger following               RT               with higher intensities of load, with the resulting total population effect being {$\mu$}\,=\,0.430 (               P               \,=\,0.060).

Training with higher loads also provoked marginally larger gains in muscle size, although the degree of training-induced muscle hypertrophy was generally small (0.056\,{$<$}\,{$\mu$}\,{$<$}\,0.136). To conclude, provided a sufficient number of repetitions is performed,               RT               at lower than traditionally recommended intensities of load may suffice to induce substantial gains in muscle strength in elderly cohorts.},

However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.}

This remains unexplored.                                                           Here, 34 untrained individuals performed contralateral resistance training with moderate and low volume for 12~weeks. Moderate volume led to larger increases in muscle cross-sectional area, strength and type II fibre-type transitions.

Out of 34 participants, thirteen displayed clear benefit of MOD on muscle hypertrophy and sixteen showed clear benefit of MOD on muscle strength gains. This coincided with greater total RNA accumulation in the early phase of the training period, suggesting that ribosomal biogenesis regulates the dose\textendash response relationship between training volume and muscle hypertrophy.                                                           These results demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent relationship between training volume and outcomes. On the individual level, benefits of higher training volume were associated with increased ribosomal biogenesis.                                                                                            Abstract                                Resistance-exercise volume is a determinant of training outcomes. However not all individuals respond in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, 34 healthy individuals (males                 n                 ~=~16, 23.6 (4.1)~years; females                 n                 ~=~18, 22.0 (1.3)~years) performed moderate- (3 sets per exercise, MOD) and low-volume (1 set, LOW) resistance training in a contralateral fashion for 12~weeks (2\textendash 3 sessions~per week). Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12, along with biopsy sampling (m. vastus lateralis). Muscle biopsies were also sampled before and 1~h after the fifth session (Week 2). MOD resulted in larger increases in muscle CSA (5.2 (3.8)\%                 versus                 3.7 (3.7)\%,                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.001) and strength (3.4\textendash 7.7\% difference, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05. This coincided with greater reductions in type IIX fibres from Week~0 to Week~12 (MOD, -4.6 percentage points; LOW -3.2 percentage points), greater phosphorylation of S6-kinase~1 (p85 S6K1                 Thr412                 , 19\%; p70 S6K1                 Thr389                 , 58\%) and ribosomal protein S6                 Ser235/236                 (37\%), greater rested-state total RNA (8.8\%) and greater exercise-induced c-Myc mRNA expression (25\%; Week~2, all                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.05). Thirteen and sixteen participants, respectively, displayed clear benefits in response to MOD on muscle hypertrophy and strength. Benefits were associated with greater accumulation of total RNA at Week~2 in the MOD leg, with every 1\% difference increasing the odds of MOD benefit by 7.0\% (                 P                 ~=~0.005) and 9.8\% (                 P                 ~=~0.002). In conclusion, MOD led to greater functional and biological adaptations than LOW. Associations between dose-dependent total RNA accumulation and increases in muscle mass and strength point to ribosome biogenesis as a determinant of dose-dependent training responses.                                       ,              Key points                                                                For individuals showing suboptimal adaptations to resistance training, manipulation of training volume is a potential measure to facilitate responses.

  note = {\guillemotleft According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over the age of 60 will increase from 605 million to 2 billion between 2000 and 20501. Falls in the elderly are considered one of the most serious and expensive public health problems in terms of morbidity, mortality, and enormous costs to health and social services\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Falls are considered a geriatric syndrome that is associated with extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The extrinsic causes are usually related to the home environment such as rugs, stairs, and poor lighting, among others6, while the intrinsic causes are related to an impairment in balance or gait, muscle weakness, decreased visual acuity, cognitive deficits, the presence of chronic disease, postural hypotension or the use of psychotropic medication\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft studies have shown that the most effective interventions for preventing falls are based on balance training and lower limb muscle strengthening\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Objectives: To analyze the effectiveness of lower limb muscle strengthening and to investigate and describe the protocols used for preventing falls in elderly subjects.\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Method: We performed a systematic review of randomized and controlled clinical trials published between 2002 and 2012 in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Results: The data obtained from the selected studies showed lower fall rates in the intervention groups compared to controls. Six studies described the lower limb muscle strengthening protocol in detail. High methodological quality was found in 6 studies (PEDro score {$\geq$}7/10 points).\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)
\par
\guillemotleft Conclusions: The methodological quality of the studies in this area appears to leave little doubt regarding the effectiveness of lower limb strengthening exercises for preventing falls in elderly subjects, however the interventions in these studies were poorly reported.\guillemotright{} (Ishigaki et al., 2014, p. 111)},

Subjects trained each leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3 times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength, muscle volume by magnetic resonance (MR) scans, as well as pre- and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise, to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in MR-measured muscle volume were significant ( P {$<$} 0.01), with no difference between groups: 30\%-3 = 6.8 {$\pm$} 1.8\%, 80\%-1 = 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.8\%, and 80\%-3= 7.2 {$\pm$} 1.9\%, P = 0.18. Isotonic maximal strength gains were not different between 80\%-1 and 80\%-3, but were greater than 30\%-3 ( P = 0.04), whereas training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but not different between conditions ( P = 0.92). Biopsies taken 1 h following the initial resistance exercise bout showed increased phosphorylation ( P {$<$} 0.05) of p70S6K only in the 80\%-1 and 80\%-3 conditions. There was no correlation between phosphorylation of any signaling protein and hypertrophy.

\par
\guillemotleft Muscle strength is considered a fundamental component of physical fitness related to quality of life.1,2 For elderly individuals, strength training is important to maintain functional ability because strength progressively declines with aging,3,4 which significantly affects the ability to perform activities of daily living.5\textendash 7 Therefore it is important to determine the optimum dose or amount of strength training that should be prescribed to increase strength in this population. A dose\textendash response relationship between strength increases and training variables such as training volume (number of repetitions per set, number of sets per exercise), training intensity (percent of one repetition maximum), and duration of training may exist in the elderly as such relationships do exist in younger individuals\guillemotright{} (Silva et al., 2014, p. 337)

\guillemotleft{} In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggested that different combinations of training variables (intensity, number of sets per muscle group, weekly training frequency) may be equally effective to improve the strength of healthy sedentary elderly people, at least in the knee extension exercise (quadriceps muscle strengthening). However, the only training variable investigated showing a significant effect-size for strength gain, within a meta-regression including the other variables, was training duration. This finding indicates that the longer the duration of resistance training programs, the greater the strength gains achieved by elderly individuals, regardless of different combinations of training intensity, frequency, or number of sets.\guillemotright{} (Silva et al., 2014, p. 343)},

  abstract = {Resistance exercise training (RT) is the most effective method for increasing skeletal muscle mass in older adults; however, the amount of RT-induced muscle growth is highly variable between individuals. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests ribosome biogenesis may be an important factor regulating RT-induced hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that the extent of hypertrophy is at least partly regulated by the amount of RT-induced ribosome biogenesis. To examine this, 42 older adults underwent 4 wk of RT aimed at inducing hypertrophy of the knee extensors (e.g., 2 sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension, 10\textendash 12 repetition maximums, 3 days/wk), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed pre- and post-RT. Post hoc K-means cluster analysis revealed distinct differences in type II myofiber hypertrophy among subjects. The percent change in type II myofiber size in nonresponders (Non; n = 17) was -7\%, moderate responders (Mod; n = 19) +22\%, and extreme responders (Xtr; n = 6) +83\%. Total muscle RNA increased only in Mod (+9\%, P {$<$} 0.08) and Xtr (+26\%, P {$<$} 0.01), and only Xtr increased rRNA content (+40\%, P {$<$} 0.05) and myonuclei/type II fiber (+32\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Additionally, Mod and Xtr had a greater increase in c-Myc protein levels compared with Non (e.g., approximately +350 and +250\% vs. +50\%, respectively, P {$<$} 0.05). In vitro studies showed that growth factor-induced human myotube hypertrophy is abolished when rRNA synthesis is knocked down using the Pol I-specific inhibitor CX-5461. Overall, these data implicate ribosome biogenesis as a key process regulating the extent of RT-induced myofiber hypertrophy in older adults.},

Two methods are commonly used in practice with no clear consensus on the most effective approach for the improvement of maximal strength.                                         Objective               The primary aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of percentage 1RM (\% 1RM) and repetition maximum targets (RM) as load prescription methods for the development of maximal strength.                                         Methods                                Electronic database searches of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were eligible for inclusion if a direct measure of maximal strength was used, a non-training control group was a comparator, the training intervention was\,{$>$}\,4~weeks in duration and was replicable, and participants were defined as healthy and between the ages of 18\textendash 40. Methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Percentage change (\%) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for all strength-based training groups were calculated. Statistical significance (                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05) was reported from each study.                                                        Results               Twenty-two studies comprising a total of 761 participants (585 males and 176 females) were found to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 studies were returned for \% 1RM, with 10 for RM. All studies showed statistically significant improvements in maximal strength in the training groups (31.3\,{$\pm$}\,21.9\%; 95\% CI 33.1\textendash 29.5\%). The mean quality rating for all studies was 17.7\,{$\pm$}\,2.3. Four studies achieved a good methodological rating, with the remainder classified as moderate.                                         Conclusions               Both \% 1RM and RM are effective tools for improving maximal strength. \% 1RM appears to be a better prescriptive method than RM potentially due to a more sophisticated management of residual fatigue. However, large heterogeneity was present within this data. Lower body and multi-joint exercises appear to be more appropriate for developing maximal strength. Greater consensus is required in defining optimal training prescriptions, physiological adaptations, and training status.},
